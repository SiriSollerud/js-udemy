defer and async used on external scripts - not used on internal scripts!

defer - executes after parsing (guaranteed script execution order)
<script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js" defer></script>
<script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

async - executes as early as possible (order of script execution is not guaranteed)
<script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js" async></script>
<script src="assets/scripts/app.js" async></script>
