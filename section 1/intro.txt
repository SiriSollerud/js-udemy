How does a webpage work?
user -> client(browser) -> request to server 
                        <- HTML response from server to client

How is js executed?
your code -> js engine -> effect on webpage
    js engine (done in browser) - happens on a single thread
    - parse code
    - compile to machine code
    - execue machine code

js is...
- dynamic = not pre-compiled instead parsed and compiled 
            "on the fly" (in broswer)
    - code evaluted and executed at runtime
    - code can change at runtime (ex: type of a variable)
- weakly typed = data types are assumed (assigned to variables) automatically
    - you don't define the data type
    - data types are not set in stone but can change 

js runs on a host environment
types of environments:
- browser-side
    - js was invented to create more dynamic websites by executing in the browser
    - js can manipulate the HTML code, CSS, send background 
      HTTP requests and much more
    - js CAN'T access the local filesystem, interact with the OS etc.
- "other" (server-side)
    - google's js engine (V8) was extracted to run js anywhere
        **called Node.js**
    - Node.js can be executed on any machine and is therefore often used
      to build web backends (server-side js)
    - Node.js CAN access the local filesystem, interact with the OS
    - Node.js CAN'T manipulate HTml or CSS

java vs. js
- java does NOT run in the browser -> js does

client-side(browser)
- the origin of js 
- allows interaction with werb page and broswer APIs (ex: get user location)
server-side(NodeJS)
- special non-browswer APIs (ex: to work w/file system, incoming HTTP reqests. etc)
